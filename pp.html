<h1 class="section-title-pp">Privacy Policy</h1>



<p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>QuackClean</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application.</p>


<p>We take your privacy seriously and are committed to complying with applicable data protection laws, including the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).</p>


<hr />


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>QuackClean is a utility application designed to help users manage device storage, organize contacts and calendar data, and gain insights into device performance. The application is designed with a strong focus on user privacy and data minimization.</p>


<p>We only collect and process information that is necessary to provide the functionality of the application and to improve its performance and reliability.</p>


<hr />


<h2>Information We Collect</h2>


<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>QuackClean does not require users to create accounts and does not directly collect personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, or email addresses.</p>


<h3>Data Accessed on Your Device</h3>
<p>With your explicit consent, the application may access certain data stored on your device, including:</p>
<ul class="ul-tos-pp">
    <li>contacts, for the purpose of identifying duplicate or similar entries;</li>
    <li>calendar events, for the purpose of identifying unnecessary or duplicate events;</li>
    <li>technical and diagnostic information such as storage usage, device model, iOS version, and crash data.</li>
</ul>


<p>This data is processed locally on your device whenever possible and is used solely to provide the requested features. We do not access the content of your personal files such as photos, messages, or emails.</p>


<hr />


<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<p>Information accessed or collected by the application is used strictly for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="ul-tos-pp">
    <li>to provide, operate, and maintain application functionality;</li>
    <li>to analyze device data and present insights or recommendations to the user;</li>
    <li>to improve application stability, performance, and user experience;</li>
    <li>to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
</ul>


<p>We do not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>


<hr />


<h2>Analytics and Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>QuackClean may use analytics services provided by Apple or other trusted third-party providers to understand how users interact with the application.</p>


<p>These services may collect anonymized and aggregated information such as application usage statistics, crash reports, and device information. This data does not directly identify individual users.</p>


<p>All third-party service providers are required to comply with applicable data protection laws and use the information solely for providing their services.</p>


<hr />


<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect information against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>


<p>Despite our efforts, no method of data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be completely secure. You acknowledge and accept this risk when using the application.</p>


<hr />


<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>QuackClean does not retain personal data longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>


<p>Most data processed by the application remains on your device and is removed when you uninstall the application, subject to Apple’s system-level behavior.</p>


<hr />


<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.</p>


<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal data through the application, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>


<hr />


<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>Under applicable data protection laws, including the UK GDPR, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data.</p>


<p>Because most data is processed locally on your device, many of these rights can be exercised directly through your device settings or by uninstalling the application.</p>


<hr />


<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.</p>


<p>Any changes will become effective when the updated Privacy Policy is made available within the application. Your continued use of the application after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>


<hr />
